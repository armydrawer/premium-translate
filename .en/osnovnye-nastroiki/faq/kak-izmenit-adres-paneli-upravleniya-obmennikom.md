# How to Change the Exchange Admin Panel URL

Go to **Settings → General Settings** and find the field labeled **Admin Panel URL**. By default, this field is set to **prmmxchngr**, so the admin panel can be accessed at `https://your_domain/prmmxchngr/`.

If you enter a custom address in the **Admin Panel URL** field—for example, **admincontrol**—then the admin panel will only be accessible at `https://your_domain/admincontrol/`.

Choose a unique admin panel URL to enhance your site's security.
