# How Are Exchange Discounts and Partner Rewards Calculated?

When you exchange currency, the size of your exchange discount depends on how many times you have exchanged before. This means the discount increases the more exchanges you make. The discount is applied to the current exchange rate. For example, if the current rate is 40 rubles per 1 dollar and your exchange discount is 1%, you will be able to exchange 1 dollar for 39.60 rubles. To set up your exchange discounts, go to the control panel and select the "**User Discounts**" section.

When you refer new users to the exchange, you can earn partner rewards based on the profit the exchange makes from each transaction your referrals complete. You can configure the portion of the exchange’s profit that will be considered when calculating your partner rewards. For instance, if the exchange’s profit margin for a specific currency pair is 100%, you will receive a percentage of the total amount exchanged by your referrals.

The size of your partner reward also grows as your referrals complete more exchanges. To adjust your partner program settings, go to the control panel and select "**Partner Program**" → "**Payouts**".
