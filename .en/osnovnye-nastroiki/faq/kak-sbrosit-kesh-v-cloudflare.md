# How to Clear the Cache in Cloudflare

Website caching helps speed up page loading for users by storing copies of important data on their devices or on intermediary servers. This reduces the load on the server, improves performance, and shortens wait times when visiting the site. Additionally, caching saves bandwidth by decreasing the amount of data transferred between the server and the client.

Sometimes, after making changes to a website’s appearance, those changes don’t show up immediately because of caching.

To force a cache purge, log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), then select **Caching -> Configuration** from the sidebar menu.

After that, all changes made to the site will be visible immediately.
