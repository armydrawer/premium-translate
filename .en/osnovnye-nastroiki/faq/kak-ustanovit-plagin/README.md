# How to Install a Plugin

{% hint style="danger" %}
Installing third-party plugins can reduce your website’s security because such plugins may contain vulnerabilities.

Additionally, after installing a plugin, the script may become unstable since it hasn’t been tested for compatibility with third-party plugins.

Upload the plugin files to the `wp-content/plugins` directory on your server using an FTP client or a file manager, then activate the plugin in the "**Plugins**" section.
