# Domain Name Change for License

To change the domain name on your current license, there must be a valid reason (such as the domain being blocked by the [RKN](https://blocklist.rkn.gov.ru/) or a similar issue). Based on this reason, the [product owner](https://t.me/premiumexchanger) will decide whether to approve or deny the domain name change in the license.

If you are renting the script, you can change the domain name in the [license](https://premiumexchanger.com/ulicense/) yourself.

Conditions for the domain name change:

1. You must renew your current license for 3 months (as if purchasing a new 3-month license).
2. The domain name can only be changed no earlier than 24 hours before the current license expires.
3. You guarantee that you will stop using our software on the old domain after the domain name change, meaning the script will be removed from the old domain (this does not apply if condition #2 is met).

As a result, you will receive: your current license validity period + 3 additional paid months + the domain name changed to the new one.

To renew your license, go to the [license page](https://premiumexchanger.com/ulicense/), click "**Renew**" for your current license, select 3 months in the cart, complete the payment, then contact the product owner and provide the new domain name for the change.
