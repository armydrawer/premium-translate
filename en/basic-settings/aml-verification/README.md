# AML Verification

AML (Anti-Money Laundering) is a service that enables cryptocurrency exchanges to detect and prevent potential cases of money laundering and other criminal activities associated with the use of cryptocurrencies.

With AML, exchanges can screen clients for connections to criminal organizations, terrorism, the financing of extremist groups, and other undesirable activities. The service allows for the verification of transactions against established rules and regulations, enabling timely detection and prevention of illegal actions.

AML boasts high accuracy in identifying suspicious transactions, thanks to the use of advanced technologies and machine learning algorithms. The service also facilitates the creation of reports and auditing of transactions, helping exchanges comply with regulatory requirements and reduce risks to their business.

Utilizing AML for a cryptocurrency exchange ensures safety for both clients and the business, as well as adherence to legal standards and regulatory demands.
