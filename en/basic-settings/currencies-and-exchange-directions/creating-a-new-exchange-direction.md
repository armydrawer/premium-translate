# Creating a New Exchange Direction

**Note:** Below is a description of all the options that can be presented in the exchange direction settings form. However, by default, some parameters may not be displayed. This is because certain modules responsible for displaying specific parameters in the form are inactive in the "**Modules**" → "**Modules**" section. The order of parameters in the exchange direction creation form on your site may differ from the order presented below.

After adding [new currencies](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/navigaciya/valyuty-i-napravleniya/dobavlenie-novoi-valyuty) and specifying [reserves for them](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/navigaciya/rezervy), create an exchange direction. To do this, go to the "**Exchange Directions**" section in the control panel. Click the "**Add**" button located above the list of already created exchanges.

On the opened page, fill in the necessary fields to create the exchange direction.

## Tab "**Basic Settings**"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(1205)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Direction** — specify the currency values for "**I Give**" and "**I Receive**".

**Technical Name** — the name of the exchange direction that will be displayed in the site control panel. Leave this field empty for automatic name generation.

**Permanent Link** — manually set the part of the link for the exchange direction: `https://your_domain/exchange-`**`LINK`**`.` This link will provide access to the created exchange direction on the site.

{% hint style="success" %}
The permanent link is automatically generated based on the selected currencies for the exchange direction, but you can change it to your own.
{% endhint %}

**Status** — set the current status of the exchange direction.

## Tab "Rate"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(1152)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Exchange Rate** — specify the current exchange rate.

**Rate Depending on Exchange Amount** — if necessary, specify the exchange rate based on the user's exchange amount.

There is also a settings block for this option in the "**Modules**" ➔ "**Rate Depending on Exchange Amount**" section.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(2149)_eng.png" alt="" width="411"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Rate Formation Method:**\
• **Set Rate Directly** — display rates for different amounts considering the specified percentages.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(2152)_eng.png" alt="" width="357"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

• **Add Percentage to Rate** — display the percentage that will be applied to the base exchange rate for different amounts.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(2151)_eng.png" alt="" width="355"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Use in XML 2.0 File with Rates** — add tiered rates from the exchange direction settings to a new export XML file:\
• **Yes**\
• **No**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(2150)_eng.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

For instance, you can create a tiered structure such that a user making a small transaction receives a lower amount per unit of currency than the standard rate — thus encouraging them to exchange larger amounts.

Setting a dependency for the "**I Receive**" side in the exchange rate (applicable when 1 in the "**I Give**" currency — for example, the BTC-USDT rate):

![](../../.gitbook/assets/64fc192780700472f4cff803%20\(1\)_eng.png)

Similarly, you can set a dependency for the "**I Give**" side in the exchange rate (applicable when 1 in the "**I Receive**" currency — for example, the USDT-BTC rate).

<mark style="color:red;">It is not recommended to set a percentage for the rate side where 1 is used</mark> — <mark style="color:red;">this will lead to displaying a rate of 0.98 to XXX or 1.32 to XXX in the exchange form</mark>

</details>

**Rate Depending on Currency Reserve** — if necessary, specify the exchange rate based on the reserve of the "**I Receive**" currency.

There is also a settings block for this option in the "**Modules**" ➔ "**Rate Depending on Reserve**" section.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(2153)_eng.png" alt="" width="458"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Rate Formation Method:**\
• **Set Rate Directly** — display rates for different amounts considering the specified percentages.\
• **Add Percentage to Rate** — display the percentage that will be applied to the base exchange rate for different amounts.

**Update Rates:**\
• **During Currency Transactions** — rates will be updated when the currency reserve changes.\
• **On the Fly** — rates will be updated when calculating amounts for requests.

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

For instance, you can create a tiered structure such that as the currency reserve decreases, the currency becomes increasingly expensive for users. The reserve is always set for the "**I Receive**" currency.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20\(784\)_eng.png)

<mark style="color:red;">It is not recommended to set a percentage for the rate side where 1 is used</mark> — <mark style="color:red;">this will lead to displaying a rate of 0.98 to XXX or 1.32 to XXX in the exchange form</mark>

</details>

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you use the option "**Rate Dependency on Amount or Reserve**," the "**I Receive**" field in the exchange form will be unavailable for filling (technical limitations of the calculation calculator).

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(1773)_eng.png" alt="" data-size="original">
{% endhint %}

**Exchange Rate from File** — more detailed information can be found [here](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/navigaciya/kursy/kurs-iz-faila).

**Exchange Amount Multiplicity** — if this option is enabled, the value selected from the dropdown will be rounded:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(855)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the amount "You Give" is selected and the multiplicity is 100 — when the user enters the amount 12345 in the exchange form in the "You Give" field, the value will be rounded down to 12300.
{% endhint %}

**Profit** — specify the profit in percentage or a fixed amount that you receive when completing the exchange. The specified profit value is used to calculate partner rewards.

When working with monitors, the standard values are 30% of the profit or 1% of the exchange amount. In the script for each exchange direction, you can set only one principle of operation (based on amount or profit) for all partners.

If zero profit is set, the partner will not be able to receive a partner reward. If profit is set at 100%, the partner will effectively receive a reward based on the exchange amount. A detailed description of this option can be found in the article ["**Profit and Partner Percentage**"](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/navigaciya/partnerskaya-programma/pribyl-i-partnerskii-procent).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the "**Profit**" block is not displayed on the tab — disable the "**Automatic Profit Calculation**" module in the "**Modules**" section.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(604)_eng.png" alt="" data-size="original">
{% endhint %}

## Tab "Cities"

To select a city for the exchange direction, you must first create a city with the correct code (according to [BestChange rules](https://www.bestchange.ru/wiki/rates.html)) in the "**Cities**" section:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(837)_eng.png" alt="" width="504"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, in the exchange direction settings, select the city in the "**Cities**" tab and, if necessary, specify additional parameters for the city:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)_eng.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Add to Rate (I Give/I Receive)** — specify the absolute value that will be added to or subtracted from the base rate set in the exchange direction.\
  To add a percentage, specify in the field, for example, `*0.9` (≈ -10%) to decrease the rate or `/0.9` (≈ +11%) to increase the rate relative to the base exchange rate.
* **Minimum/Maximum Amount** — specify the amounts that will limit the exchange of funds for the added city (minimum and maximum amounts are specified for the currency "I Give"). These limits apply to exchanges on the site and in the exported XML file.
* **Profit (from Amount I Give/I Receive)** — individual profit values that may differ from the overall profit values on the "**Rate**" tab.
* **Tags for param parameter** — specify parameters according to [BestChange requirements](https://www.bestchange.ru/wiki/rates.html).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(159)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Tab "BestChange API Parser" and "BestChange Parser"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(856)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Detailed descriptions of the options can be found in the articles "[**BestChange API Parser**](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/kursy-valyut/bestchange-api-parser-new-nachinaya-s-v2.6)" and "[**BestChange Parser**](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/kursy-valyut/bestchange-parser-old)".

## Tab "Auto-Rate Adjustment"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(883)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Auto-Rate Adjustment** — select the source and direction for automatic rate changes on the site.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To enable automatic currency updates, you need to configure a [cron job](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/kursy-valyut/parser-kursov-valyut-parsery-2.0) on your server. At the top of the "**Parsers 2.0**" section, you will find a link labeled "**Cron URL for updating exchange rates for the Central Bank and cryptocurrencies**," which should be added to the server's task scheduler. You can perform updates every minute. More detailed information can be found [here](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/kursy-valyut/parser-kursov-valyut-parsery-2.0).
{% endhint %}

**Adjusting the Rate** — This parameter allows you to modify the exchange rate obtained from the source to suit your needs. For the currency column you are giving, you should leave it as "**0**" (zero). In the column for the currency you are receiving, you need to specify a percentage or a numerical value (negative values are allowed). This value will be automatically added to the source rate and displayed on the website with the corresponding adjustment.

Please note that authorized users automatically participate in a loyalty program that rewards them with discounts based on the amount they have already exchanged with you. This commission will be automatically added to the specified rate. To configure the loyalty program, go to the "**User Discounts**" section. In the window that opens, you will see fields where you can modify the parameters of your loyalty program.

## "Exchange Rate Restrictions" Tab

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(1068)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Min. Rate/Max. Rate** — If necessary, you can set a minimum/maximum rate within which the connected rate parser will operate. If the rate exceeds the minimum/maximum limit, it can be reset to the standard rate; otherwise, the last received value will be retained until the rate returns to the specified range.

**Standard Rate** — If necessary, specify the standard rate to which the reset will occur when the rate goes outside the specified range.

## "Reserve" Tab

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(1217)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Reserve** — If needed, you can set a personal reserve value for the exchange direction. The selected option will take precedence over the reserve value set in the "**Receiving**" currency settings in the "**Currencies**" section. You can also set a [reserve from a file](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/navigaciya/rezervy/rezerv-iz-faila), connect an auto-reserve, or specify a reserve from the field located below.

**Reserve Field** — If necessary, for the "**Reserve**" option, select the value "**—From the field below—**," and for the "**Reserve Field**" parameter, specify the reserve value. The specified reserve value will be displayed on the website for the created exchange direction. This option is used only as a limiter for the current reserve value and will only work if a currency reserve is set in the "**Reserve Adjustment**" section. For example, if you set a reserve of 100,000 in the "**Reserve Adjustments**" section, but you need to limit this value to 50,000 for the created exchange direction, use the "**Reserve Field**" parameter to restrict the reserve value.

**Calculator** — If necessary, for the "**Reserve**" option, select the value "**—By formula—**," and for the "**Calculator**" parameter, specify the reserve formula. More detailed information can be found [here](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/rezervy-valyut/rezerv-ot-drugoi-valyuty/primery-nastroiki-slozhnogo-rezerva-s-ispolzovaniem-formul).

More detailed information can be found [here](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/navigaciya/faq/chto-takoe-nestandartnaya-komissiya-v-nastroikakh-merchanta-i-kak-ona-rabotaet).

**Min. Fee Amount** — Specify the minimum fee amount that the payment system can charge for transferring funds, if such an amount is provided by the payment system. If you enter "**0**" (zero), there will be no restrictions. If a limit is set, some fields in the application creation form will become inactive.

## "Exchange Point Fees" Tab

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image%20(959)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Additional Fee from Sender** — Specify the additional fee (fromfee) that will be added to the payment amount if such a fee is provided by the exchange service's regulations. This value will be displayed in the XML file with rates for monitoring in the \<fromfee> parameter.

**Additional Fee from Recipient** — Specify the additional fee (tofee) that will be deducted from the received amount if such a fee is provided by the exchange service's regulations. This value will be displayed in the XML file with rates for monitoring in the \<tofee> parameter.

**Additional Fee Based on Exchange Amount** — Set the dependency of the fee charged to the client based on the exchange amount.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that when using this option, the values specified below will apply — the data entered in the "**Additional Fee from Sender/Recipient**" fields will not be considered in the calculations.

## "Request Recalculation" Tab

The Electrum module for receiving funds allows for canceling transactions and replacing them, which can lead to losses for the exchanger if the settings below are not configured in your exchanger. No such cases have been found for other merchants, but we recommend using the settings below for complete protection of your funds.

Feel free to ask if you need any further assistance!

When using merchants for accepting payments, it is **essential** to recalculate the application amount at least for the status "**Paid Application**" in the exchange direction settings (other statuses can be marked optionally at your discretion).

Alternatively, you can set up automatic transfer of applications to the status "**Under Review**" if the actual payment amount is less than the original amount (this option is found in the merchant module settings for accepting payments).

These options are used to recalculate the exchange amount if the exchange rate or the payment amount in the application has changed.

### **Recalculation Based on Payment Amount**

The Electrum service for receiving BTC allows for transaction cancellations and substitutions, which can lead to losses for the exchange if the settings mentioned below are not configured in your exchange and a fraudster takes advantage of this feature of Electrum. If you are using the [Electrum module](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/modul-electrum), it is **crucial** to perform the following configuration.

When using merchants for accepting payments, it is **mandatory** to recalculate the application amount at least for the status "**Paid Application**" in the exchange direction settings.

You need to select the conditions under which the payout amount will be recalculated in case of a change in the [payment amount](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

**Recalculation of the application if the payment amount has changed** — conditions under which recalculation will occur:

Example:\
**A user created an application to exchange USD for DOGE:**\
• **rate 12.853 to 1**\
• **amount to pay 1000 USD**\
• **amount to receive 77.803 DOGE**

**The amounts to be paid and received were fixed at the time of application creation.**

If the option is enabled, the payout amount will be recalculated based on the condition:

• **No** — the option is disabled\
• **Yes, always** — recalculation will occur with any changes in the application\
• **Yes, if the payment amount has changed** — recalculation will occur with any change in the amount

_If the actual amount paid by the user has changed to 990 USD, and the rate has not changed_ — _the amount to receive will be 77.024 DOGE_\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the actual amount paid by the user has changed to 1010 USD, and the rate has not changed_ — _the amount to receive will be 78.58 DOGE_\
• **Yes, if the payment amount has increased** — recalculation will occur only if the rate increases\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the actual amount paid by the user has changed to 990 USD, and the rate has not changed_ — _the amount to receive will remain unchanged_\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the actual amount paid by the user has changed to 1010 USD, and the rate has not changed_ — _the amount to receive will be 78.58 DOGE_\
• **Yes, if the payment amount has decreased** — recalculation will occur only if the rate decreases\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the actual amount paid by the user has changed to 990 USD, and the rate has not changed_ — _the amount to receive will be 77.024 DOGE_\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the actual amount paid by the user has changed to 1010 USD, and the rate has not changed_ — _the amount to receive will remain unchanged_

### **Recalculation Based on Exchange Rate**

You can set up recalculation based on the exchange rate on a schedule using the option from the "**Exchange Settings**" -> "**Basic Settings**".

* **When the application status changes** — recalculation will occur similarly to recalculation based on the exchange amount — **only** when the application status changes
* **By cron** — set up a [cron job](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/faq/kak-sozdat-zadanie-cron-na-servere) to run recalculation on a schedule. The link for the cron job can be found in the "**Settings**" -> "**Cron**" section
* **Always** — recalculation will occur both when the cron job runs and when the application status changes

Select the conditions under which the exchange amount will be recalculated in case of a change in the exchange rate in the direction.

**Recalculation of the application if the rate has changed** — conditions under which recalculation will occur:

Example:\
**A user created an application to exchange USD for DOGE:**\
• **rate 12.853 to 1**\
• **amount to pay 1000 USD**\
• **amount to receive 77.803 DOGE**

**The amounts to be paid and received were fixed at the time of application creation.**

The exchange rate constantly changes — if the option is enabled, the rate will be recalculated based on the condition:

• **No** — the option is disabled\
• **Yes, always** — recalculation will occur with any changes in the application\
• **Yes, if the rate has changed** — recalculation will occur with any change in the rate

_If the rate changes from 12.853 to 12.85, the amount to pay will change_ — _the amount to receive will be 77.821 DOGE_\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the rate changes from 12.853 to 12.9, the amount to pay will change_ — _the amount to receive will be 77.519 DOGE_\
• **Yes, if the rate increases** — recalculation will occur only if the rate increases\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the rate changes from 12.853:1 to 12.8:1, the amounts to pay and receive will remain unchanged_\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the rate changes from 12.853:1 to 12.9:1, the amount to pay will change_ — _the amount to receive will be 77.519 DOGE_\
• **Yes, if the rate decreases** — recalculation will occur only if the rate decreases

_If the rate changes from 12.853:1 to 12.8:1, the amount to pay will change_ — _the amount to receive will be 78.125 DOGE_\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;f the rate changes from 12.853:1 to 12.9:1, the amounts to pay and receive will remain unchanged_

In the admin panel, click on the line "**Time for Rate Recalculation**".

All changes in the rate and amounts for the selected application will be displayed on a separate page.

**Application Status for Recalculation** — select the status(es) of applications for which the exchange amount will be recalculated. Recalculation will occur only if the transition is to a status highlighted in the list.

**Perform Recalculation After** — the time after the application is created, after which recalculation will occur (delay).

For example, if set to 5 minutes, there will be no recalculation during this time after the application is created, even if the conditions for recalculation are met.

## SEO Tab

## Merchants and Payouts Tab

**Merchant** — if you want the payment for the application to be processed through a merchant, select the corresponding merchant for accepting payment from the client. The merchant allows you to accept payments through the payment system's website. If no merchant is selected, the client will need to make the payment manually according to the instructions they will see after creating the application. Read more about [merchant settings](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/en/basic-settings/merchants-and-auto-payments/merchants/general-merchant-settings).

**Daily Limit for Merchant** — the daily limit for accepting funds for the merchant. The merchant will not be able to accept payments exceeding the specified limit.

**Monthly Limit for Merchant** — the monthly limit for accepting funds for the merchant. The merchant will not be able to accept payments exceeding the specified limit.

**Maximum Payment Amount for a Single Request** — This is the highest payment amount allowed for a single request. The merchant will not be able to accept payments exceeding this limit.

**Auto Payments** — If you want the system to automatically pay out money to the client for a request, select the name of the relevant payment system through which the auto payment will be processed. If you do not make a selection, payments for requests will need to be processed manually by the administrator/operator of the exchange point. Read more about [auto payment settings](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/merchants-and-auto-payments/auto-payments/obshie-nastroiki-avtovyplat).

**Auto Payment for Requests with "Paid Request" Status:**\
• **Yes** — Auto payment will be processed automatically without operator involvement when the request has the status "Paid Request."\
• **No** — Manual confirmation of the auto payment for the request is required.\
• **Default** — This option will default to the settings specified in the corresponding auto payment module.

**Auto Payment for Requests with "Under Review" Status:**\
• **Yes** — Auto payment will be processed automatically without operator involvement when the request has the status "Under Review."\
• **No** — Manual confirmation of the auto payment for the request is required.\
• **Default** — This option will default to the settings specified in the corresponding auto payment module.

**Daily Limit for Auto Payments** — This is the daily limit for fund withdrawals for the module. Auto payments cannot exceed this specified limit.

**Monthly Limit for Auto Payments** — This is the monthly limit for fund withdrawals for the module. Auto payments cannot exceed this specified limit.

**Minimum Auto Payment Amount for a Request** — This is the minimum amount for automatic payments for a single request. If the payment amount for the request is equal to or less than this set value, the automatic payment will not occur. The request can only be processed manually.

**Maximum Auto Payment Amount for a Request** — This is the maximum amount for automatic payments for a single request. If the payment amount for the request is equal to or exceeds this set value, the automatic payment will not occur. The request can only be processed manually.

**Delay for Auto Payments in Hours** — This is the number of hours that the auto payment will be delayed. After the specified time has passed, the auto payment will occur. Additional configuration of the [task scheduler (cron)](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/faq/kak-sozdat-zadanie-cron-na-servere) on the server is required to check the timing of the auto payment. The script can be run every minute.

**Who the Delay Applies To:**\
• "**For everyone**," "**for unregistered users**," or "**for unverified users on the site**" — Delay auto payments for all users or only for unregistered users on the site, respectively.\
• "**For newcomers**" — Delay auto payments only for users who are exchanging for the first time. The system identifies "newcomers" based on the settings specified in the "**Exchange Settings" → "Exchange Settings" → "Newcomer Check"** section.
