**How Are Exchange Discounts and Partner Rewards Calculated?**

When you exchange currency, the size of your exchange discount depends on how many times you’ve exchanged in the past. In other words, the more exchanges you make, the larger your discount becomes. The discount is applied to the current exchange rate. For example, if the current exchange rate is 40 rubles per 1 dollar and your exchange discount is 1%, you’ll be able to exchange 1 dollar for 39.60 rubles. To configure exchange discounts, go to the control panel and select the "**User Discounts**" section.

When you refer new users to the exchange platform, you can earn partner rewards based on the profit the platform makes from each exchange completed by your referrals. You can adjust the percentage of the platform’s profit that will be used to calculate your partner reward. For instance, if the platform’s profit for a specific exchange direction is 100%, you will receive a percentage of the total amount exchanged by your referrals.

The size of your partner reward also increases as the number of exchanges completed by your referrals grows. To configure the parameters of the partner program, go to the control panel and select "**Partner Program**" → "**Payouts**."

**Applying Discounts When Creating Orders**

A user’s discount is only applied if the order is created while logged into an authorized account. If a user creates an order without logging in, their personal or cumulative discount will not be applied, even if the email provided in the order form matches the email of a registered account.

It is recommended to inform clients about the importance of logging in before placing an order—this is the only way the system can automatically apply their discount.
