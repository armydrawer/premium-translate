# How to Back Up a Website?

There are several ways to create a complete backup of your website:

1. **Recommended for beginners:**\
   Contact your hosting provider's technical support team and request a full backup of your website (including both the site files and the database). Additionally, ask for instructions on how to restore the backup if needed.
2.  **Recommended for advanced users:**\
    Use the ISP Manager control panel to create a backup yourself:

    — In the "**Main** → **Databases**" section, select your website's database and click the "**Dump**" or "**Export**" button.

    — In the "**Main** → **File Manager**" section, navigate to the root folder of your website. Select all the files and folders of your site and click the "**Download**" button.
