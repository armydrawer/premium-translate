# How to Change the Admin Panel Address for the Exchange Platform?

In the "**Settings → General Settings**" section, locate the field labeled "**Admin Panel URL**." By default, this field is set to **prmmxchngr**, which means the admin panel can be accessed at the following address: `https://your_domain/prmmxchngr/`.

If you replace the value in the "**Admin Panel URL**" field with a custom address, such as **admincontrol**, the admin panel will then only be accessible at `https://your_domain/admincontrol/`.

Make sure to set a unique admin panel address to enhance your website's security.
