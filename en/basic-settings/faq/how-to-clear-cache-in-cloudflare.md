# How to Clear Cache in Cloudflare

Website caching helps speed up page loading for users by storing copies of important data on their devices or intermediate servers. This reduces server load, improves performance, and shortens wait times when visiting the site. Additionally, caching helps save bandwidth by reducing the amount of data transferred between the server and the client.

However, in some cases, changes made to the website’s appearance may not be immediately visible due to caching.

To force a cache reset, log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and in the side menu, navigate to the "**Caching -> Configuration**" section.

Click the "**Purge Everything**" button and confirm the cache reset in the next window.

Once this is done, all changes made to the website will be reflected.
