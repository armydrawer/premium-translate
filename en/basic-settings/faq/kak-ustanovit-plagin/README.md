# How to Install a Plugin?

{% hint style="danger" %}
Installing third-party plugins can reduce your website's security level, as such plugins may contain vulnerabilities.

Additionally, after installing a plugin, the script may become unstable because it has not been tested for compatibility with third-party plugins.
{% endhint %}

Upload the plugin files to the `wp-content/plugins` directory on your server using an FTP client or a file manager. Then, activate the plugin in the "**Plugins**" section.
