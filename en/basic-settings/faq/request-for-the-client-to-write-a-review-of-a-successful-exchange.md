#### Request for Clients to Leave Feedback on a Successful Exchange

To enhance the reputation of your exchange service, we recommend that you, as the owner, encourage clients to leave reviews on your website, review platforms, monitoring services, and forums.

#### Adding a Request to Leave a Review

The most convenient way to ask users to leave a review is by including the request on the exchange confirmation page and in the email they receive after completing the exchange.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="On the Exchange Confirmation Page" %}
In the **Exchange Directions -> Exchange Template** section, add a message to the "**Completed Exchange**" status template. Be sure to include **direct links** to your profiles on review platforms, forums, and monitoring services!

This is how the template will appear on the exchange confirmation page:

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="In the Email" %}
In the **Messages -> Email Templates** section, configure the email template for the "**Completed Exchange**" status. This email will be sent to the client upon completion of their exchange.

#### Template Text for the Exchange Confirmation Page and Email

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important! When copying and pasting the text into your website’s admin panel, replace the placeholder text `YOUR_LINK` with the actual link to your profile or page on the specified platform.

Here’s the text you can use:
