# Domain Name Change for a License

To change the domain name associated with your current license, there must be a valid reason (e.g., domain blocking by [Roskomnadzor (RKN)](https://blocklist.rkn.gov.ru/) or a similar issue). Based on this reason, the [product owner](https://t.me/premiumexchanger) will decide whether to approve or deny the domain name change request.

If you are renting the script, you can change the domain name in the [license](https://premiumexchanger.com/ulicense/) yourself.

### Conditions for a Domain Name Change:

1. You must extend your current license by 3 months (as if purchasing a new 3-month license).
2. The domain name can only be changed no earlier than one day before the current license expires.
3. You must guarantee that the software will no longer be used on the old domain after the domain name change. In other words, the script must be removed from the old domain (this condition does not apply if condition #2 is met).

### What You Get:

- The remaining time on your current license.
- An additional 3 months of license validity (paid extension).
- The ability to change the domain name to a new one.

### How to Extend and Change the Domain Name:

1. Go to the [license page](https://premiumexchanger.com/ulicense/).
2. Click "**Extend**" for your current license.
3. In the cart, select a 3-month extension and complete the payment.
4. Contact the product owner and provide the new domain name for the change.
