# Adding or Creating a Copy of an Auto-Payment

By default, the system already has all available auto-payments set up, but let's go through the process of adding a new auto-payment or creating a copy of an existing one. The procedure is the same for all payment systems.

1. In the website control panel, go to the "**Merchants → Auto-Payments**" section and click the "**Add**" button located above the table.

2. Fill out the form that appears:

* **Title** — Enter the name of the merchant for the auto-payment, which will be displayed in the website control panel.
* **Module** — Select the name of the payment system for which you are creating the module.
* **Status** — Choose "**active auto-payment**."

3. For further auto-payment settings, follow the [instructions](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/merchants-and-auto-payments/avtovyplaty) specific to each payment system.
