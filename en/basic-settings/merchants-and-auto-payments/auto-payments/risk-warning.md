# Risk Warning!

{% hint style="danger" %}
Activating automatic payments is done at your own risk. The script developer is not responsible for the safety of your funds in payment system accounts, although every effort has been made to protect and secure them. We do not recommend enabling automatic payments unless absolutely necessary. Active automatic payments significantly increase the risk of losing your money in one payment system or another in the event of a website or hosting/server hack where your site is located.
{% endhint %}

When setting up automatic payments, it is crucial to be very careful. Failing to follow even one step of the instructions may cause the automatic payments to function incorrectly. Special attention should be paid to API keys and their security. A leak of this information could harm your exchange service.

We strongly recommend activating all possible identity verification methods for each connected payment system: SMS authorization, SMS confirmation of transfers, email confirmation, IP address restrictions for API access, personal account access, etc. Each payment system has its own set of security measures, so itâ€™s important to clarify this with the technical support of the respective system. We will provide recommended security settings for each payment system below.

For payment systems, it is advisable to use a completely new mobile phone number for SMS confirmations and keep it anonymous, meaning it should be used solely for SMS confirmations.

When operating the site in automatic mode with operator confirmation, please use the [security code](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/basic-settings/nastroiki/administratory-i-polzovateli/paroli-bezopasnosti) (point 2).
