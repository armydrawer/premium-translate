**SBP** — provide a phone number for payments via SBP instead of card details in requests.

Please note that you also need to forward the URL for the Webhook from the module settings to the service representative, requesting them to set it up for you. Without this URL being installed, requests with underpayments/overpayments **will not change their statuses**!
