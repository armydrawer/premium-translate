## Merchant Account Settings

First, register in the [Rapira](https://rapira.net/) system.

Log into your account, complete the verification process, and enable two-factor authentication (Google Auth).

After successfully completing verification and setting up Google Auth, go to the "**Settings - API Keys**" section and click the "**Create API Key**" button.

## Special Fields

**Required Number of Transaction Confirmations** - a confirmed transaction means it has been included in a block and, therefore, in the blockchain. It has been verified and recorded, the payment has been processed, and it cannot be changed or canceled. To be considered legitimate, the operation must receive a certain number of confirmations. Each new confirmation exponentially reduces the risk of the transaction being reversed.

{% hint style="info" %}
* <mark style="color:green;">Recommended!</mark> Set the value to 0 so that the request is considered paid only after receiving the required number of confirmations on the exchange.
* <mark style="color:red;">Not recommended!</mark> If you set a value other than 0, the exchange will change the status of the request to "Paid" based on this setting, regardless of the transaction status displayed in the exchange's payment history. By enabling this option, you accept any associated risks.
{% endhint %}

## Continuing the Setup

Next, proceed to configure the merchant by following the [general setup instructions](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/en/en/basic-settings/merchants-and-auto-payments/merchants/general-merchant-settings).
