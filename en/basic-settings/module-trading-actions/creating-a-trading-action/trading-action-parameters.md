# Trading Action Parameters

{% hint style="info" %}
The set of parameters and steps in the trading actions module varies across different exchanges. If a parameter or an entire step described below is missing in the trading action you are configuring, this is completely normal — you can skip that section in the instructions.

**The screenshots below are based on working with Binance.**
{% endhint %}

## Authorization in the Module

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (692)_eng.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**API Key** — the key generated in your Binance account.

**Secret Key** — the secret key generated in your Binance account.

It is recommended to issue a separate key with the necessary permissions for trading actions, especially if you are already using Binance for merchant services and/or auto-payouts.

The permissions required for all module functions are highlighted below.

**Execution Order** — specifies the order in which actions are executed (if multiple trading actions are used for the same exchange directions). Enter values from [1 to 10](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] for each trading action involved. Leave the field empty if you are using only one action.

**Assign Actions** — select the application status at which the action will be executed. Only one option can be selected.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using the "After status "**Paid Application**" option for "**Buy**" and "**Sell**" actions.
{% endhint %}

**Exchange Directions** — select the exchange directions for which trading actions will be executed when processing applications. You can select multiple directions with the same currency in either the "**Give**" or "**Receive**" fields simultaneously.

**Error Margin (%)** — specify the error margin percentage (only a number) for the application amount to be used in the action. Typically, a value between 0.1 and 0.5 is used (the optimal value is 0.15).

## Step: "Borrow"

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (696)_eng.png" alt="" width="515"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Enabled:**\
• **Yes** \
• **No**

**Currency Code** — specify the currency code to <mark style="color:yellow;">**borrow**</mark> in this step.

**Network** — specify the network for the currency from the "**Currency Code**" field (optional, only if the currency has a network).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Choose the amount from the "**Give**" or "**Receive**" side depending on the currency involved in the action (the side of the currency pair must match the currency specified in the "**Currency Code**" field).

If the exchange direction does not have merchants connected for receiving/auto-payouts, the payment/payout amount will be 0. If the trading action amount is set to "**Payment Amount**" or "**Payout Amount**" in such cases, the trading action will fail because it will attempt to execute with an amount of 0.

If you encounter a trading action error related to this, edit the amount in the application (go to the "**Applications**" section, click "**Edit**",\
![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (376)_eng.png>)&#x20;

enter the correct amount in the required field, save the changes, and manually restart the trading action by clicking the "**Action Link**" in the "**Trading Actions**" -> "**Applications**" section. The trading action will then execute successfully.
