# Displaying the Number of Confirmations in the Request

{% hint style="info" %}
To select the shortcode in the shortcode panel, you need to activate the "**Transaction Confirmation Counter (Crypto)**" module in the "**Modules**" section.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that for the number of confirmations to be displayed, the merchant must provide this information via API. In 90% of cases, this does not happen due to a lack of data from the merchant.
{% endhint %}

If a merchant is used for accepting cryptocurrencies, you can display the number of transaction confirmations on the request page for the user. To do this, go to the "**Exchange Directions**" section, edit the exchange direction, and select the "**User Information**" tab.

Find the text field labeled "**Request Status**" with the value "**new request**." Above the text field, there is a panel with shortcodes. The shortcode responsible for displaying the number of confirmations is "**Number of Confirmations**." Place your cursor in the field where you want to display the number of confirmations, then click on the shortcode "**Number of Confirmations**." The text field will show the code in square brackets **\[confirm\_count]**, which will be converted on the request page into the actual number of confirmations.

Repeat the above procedure with the text field labeled "**Request Status: waiting for confirmation from the merchant**."
