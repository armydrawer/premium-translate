# Diagnostics

In the "**T-API-bots**" -> "**Logs**" section, you will find logs generated during your interactions with the bot. These logs are useful for diagnosing errors.

The error messages are unique to each situation, so it is highly recommended to provide the error text when contacting technical support.
