# Identity Verification (KYC)

The script includes identity verification with the option to upload images. There is also the ability to restrict access to the exchange direction, making it available only to users who have been verified on the site, as well as to offer additional discounts on exchanges for verified users.

To activate identity verification, please follow these steps:

1. In the website control panel, go to the "**Modules" → "Modules"** section and activate the "**User Verification**" module.

4. In the website control panel, navigate to the "**Messages" → "Email Templates"** section to configure and enable the relevant templates: "**Identity Verification Request**," "**Successful Identity Verification**," and "**Identity Verification Denial**."
   
5. In the exchange direction settings, under the "**Verification**" tab, set the parameter "**Only for verified users on the site**" to "**Yes**." In this case, only users who have been verified on the site will be able to submit requests.
