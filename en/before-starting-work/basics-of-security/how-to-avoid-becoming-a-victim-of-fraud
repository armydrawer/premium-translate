# How to Avoid Becoming a Victim of Fraud

* We strongly advise against purchasing supposedly licensed products from third-party websites, as licensed and safe products can only be obtained from our official sites [**Best-Curs.info**](https://best-curs.info/) and [**PremiumExchanger.com**](https://premiumexchanger.com/). We do not have any partners selling our products. Third-party sites may sell products that have been tampered with by fraudulent sellers, allowing them to remotely control the site, alter payment details, and access merchant data. Do not trust just anyone with your money. Use only licensed products to protect your funds and maintain your reputation.
* We never ask you to send us back a copy of the products to fix vulnerabilities.
* Do not sell copies of products to third partiesâ€”this can harm the functionality of your site, violates our [license agreement](https://premiumexchanger.com/terms-personal-data/), and in some cases, may lead to unauthorized deductions from your account. Products are tied to a specific domain, so third parties will not be able to use them. Offers to purchase copies of products often come from scammers.
* We do not send product update files via email. Our newsletters are purely informational and only notify you of new updates. You can download available product updates only from your [personal account](https://premiumexchanger.com/uscripts/).
* Exchange administrators often receive emails with attachments (archives, .pdf and .doc files, images, etc.) that contain viruses and trojans. Do not open such attachments unless absolutely necessary. Always scan attachments with antivirus software.
* You can purchase products, modules, and merchants only through our official websites. We do not sell products via ICQ, Skype, email, or similar channels. Be wary of scammers who offer to sell you products at a lower price through dubious communication methods.

Our service provides user support exclusively through the following communication channels:

* Skype: [hi_firer](skype:hi_firer?add)

* Online chat on the website

If someone contacts you on our behalf using similar or different contact details, we recommend ignoring such communication.
