# Server Selection

To ensure the script runs smoothly, you will need a server with the following minimum specifications:

* 4 GB of RAM
* Ubuntu 20.x or 22.x
* ISP Manager server control panel or the ability to install it
* Nginx + Apache web server

Other specifications are up to you, but pay attention to the storage capacity of the server to ensure there is enough space for the database, module logs, backups, and other data (at least 50 GB). Typically, a VPS with SSD storage is used for cryptocurrency exchanges.
