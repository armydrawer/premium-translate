---

### Step 2: Add the PHP Repository

To upgrade to PHP 8.2, you need to add the PHP repository to your system. Use the following commands in the terminal to add the repository:

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
```

---

### Step 3: Upgrade PHP

Once the repository is added and the system is updated, you can install PHP 8.2 using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install php8.2
```

During the installation, you may be prompted to confirm the update and enter your password. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.

### Step 4: Verify the PHP Update

After the installation is complete, run the following command to ensure PHP 8.2 is installed:

```bash
php -v
```

---

### Step 5: Install PHP 8.2 Extensions

If your projects require specific PHP extensions, you can install them using the `apt` package manager. For example:

```bash
sudo apt install php8.2
```

---

### Step 6: Restart the Web Server

If you’re using PHP with a web server like Apache or Nginx, you’ll need to restart the server for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart # For Apache
sudo service nginx restart   # For Nginx
```

---

**Note:** If your system still shows an older PHP version, you can use the following command to select the new version from the available options:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config php
```

Afterward, recheck the PHP version your web server is using.

### Switching PHP Versions for the Premium Exchanger Script

Download and upload the appropriate distribution files for **the installed script version and the new PHP version.**

- **Installation files** — Use these if you’re installing the script from scratch.
- **Update files** — Use these if you’re updating an existing script.

1. Upload the archive to the root folder of your server and extract it, replacing the existing files.
