# How to Check the PHP Version Used by Your Website

## Using ISP Manager

Log in to ISP Manager with any user account that has access to the website's files, and navigate to the "**Sites**" section. In the "**Handler**" column, you will see the PHP version currently being used by the website.

## Checking the PHP Version in a Browser

Connect to your server via FTP or SSH and navigate to the root directory of your website. Create a file named [`phpversion.php`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] with the following content:

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

Next, open your website in a browser and append the file's name to the URL in the address bar:

If everything is set up correctly, a large table containing information about PHP and its installed extensions will be displayed. At the very top of the page, you will see the PHP version.

If you donâ€™t want to display the entire table of PHP information, you can output just the PHP version. To do this, replace the content of the `phpversion.php` file with the following line:

```php
<?php echo phpversion(); ?>
```

As a result, you will see a page like this:
