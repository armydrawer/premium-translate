### Request for Clients to Leave Feedback on a Successful Exchange

To enhance the reputation of your exchange service, we recommend that you, as the owner, encourage clients to leave reviews on your website, review platforms, monitoring services, and forums.

In the current market, it’s common to offer a small monetary reward (typically $5–$10) as a token of appreciation for leaving a review after completing an exchange.

### Adding a Request to Leave a Review

The most convenient way to ask users to leave a review is by including the request on the exchange confirmation page and in the email they receive after completing the exchange.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="On the Exchange Confirmation Page" %}
In the **Exchange Directions -> Exchange Template** section, add a message to the "**Completed Exchange**" status template. Be sure to include **direct links** to your profiles on review platforms, forums, and monitoring services!

This is how the template will appear on the exchange confirmation page:

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="In the Email" %}
In the **Messages -> Email Templates** section, configure the email template for the "**Completed Exchange**" status. This email will be sent to the client upon completion of their exchange.
