# Adding or Creating a Copy of an Auto Payout

By default, all available auto payouts are already set up in the system. However, let's go through the process of adding a new auto payout or creating a copy of an existing one. The procedure is the same for all payment systems.

1. In the website control panel, go to **"Merchants" → "Auto Payouts"** and click the **"Add"** button located above the table.

2. Fill out the form that appears:

* **Title** — enter the name of the auto payout merchant as it will appear in the website control panel  
* **Module** — select the payment system for which you are creating the module  
* **Status** — choose **"Active Auto Payout"**

3. Complete the remaining auto payout settings according to the [instructions](https://premium.gitbook.io/rukovodstvo-polzovatelya/navigaciya/merchanty-i-avtovyplaty/avtovyplaty) for each payment system.
