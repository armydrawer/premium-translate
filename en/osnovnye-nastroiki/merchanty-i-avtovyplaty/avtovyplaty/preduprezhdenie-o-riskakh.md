# Risk Warning!

{% hint style="danger" %}
Enabling automatic payouts is done at your own risk. The script developer is not responsible for the safety of your funds in payment system accounts, although every possible measure has been taken to protect and secure them. We do not recommend enabling automatic payouts unless absolutely necessary. Active automatic payouts significantly increase the risk of losing your money in any payment system in the event of a website or hosting/server breach where your site is located.

When setting up automatic payouts, you must be extremely careful. If even one step of the instructions is not followed correctly, the automatic payouts may malfunction. Special attention should be paid to API keys and keeping them secure. Leakage of this information can harm your exchange service.

We strongly recommend enabling all available identity verification measures for each connected payment system: SMS authorization, SMS transfer confirmation, email confirmation, IP address restrictions for API access and personal accounts, etc. Each payment system has its own set of security features, so be sure to check with the technical support of the respective system. Below, we will provide recommended security settings for each payment system.

For payment systems, it is advisable to use a completely new mobile phone number exclusively for SMS confirmations and keep it anonymousâ€”used solely for SMS verification purposes.

When operating your site in automatic mode with operator confirmation, use the [security code](https://premium.gitbook.io/rukovodstvo-polzovatelya/navigaciya/nastroiki/kod-bezopasnosti).
