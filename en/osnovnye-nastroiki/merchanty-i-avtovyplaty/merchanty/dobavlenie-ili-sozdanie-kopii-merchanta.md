# Adding or Creating a Copy of a Merchant

By default, all available merchants are already set up in the system. However, let's go through the process of adding a new merchant or creating a copy of an existing one. The procedure is the same for all merchants.

1. In the website control panel, go to **"Merchants" → "Merchants"** and click the **"Add"** button located above the table.
2. Fill out the form that appears:

* **Title** — enter the name of the merchant as it will appear in the website control panel;
* **Module** — select the payment system module you are creating from the dropdown list;
* **Status** — choose **"Active Merchant"**.

3. Complete the remaining merchant settings according to the instructions for each specific payment system.
