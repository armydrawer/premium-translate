# Adding or Creating a Merchant Copy

By default, all available merchants are already set up in the system, but let's go through the process of adding a new merchant or creating a copy of an existing one. The procedure is the same for all merchants.

1. In the website control panel, go to the "**Merchants" → "Merchants"** section and click the "**Add**" button located above the table.
2. Fill out the form that appears:

* **Title** — Enter the name of the merchant that will be displayed in the website control panel.
* **Module** — Select the name of the payment system for which you are creating the module from the dropdown list.
* **Status** — Choose "**active merchant**."

3. Configure the additional settings for the merchant according to the instructions for each payment system.
