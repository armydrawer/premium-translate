## Merchant Account Settings

Register on the [Garantex website](https://garantex.org/). After your registration is confirmed by the service, log in to your personal account. Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication) for your account.

To enable the merchant to receive funds, the "**Readonly**" permission is sufficient—do not select any other permissions. For added security, it’s recommended to specify your server’s IP address in the "IPs" field.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

**Required Number of Transaction Confirmations** — A confirmed transaction means it has been included in a block and, therefore, in the blockchain. It has been verified and recorded, the payment has been processed, and it cannot be altered or reversed. For a transaction to be considered valid, it must receive a certain number of confirmations. Each additional confirmation exponentially reduces the risk of the transaction being reversed.

{% hint style="info" %}
- <mark style="color:green;">Recommended!</mark> Set the value to 0 so that the order is considered paid only after the required number of confirmations is received on the exchange.
- <mark style="color:red;">Not recommended!</mark> If you set a value other than 0, the exchanger will mark the order as "Paid" according to this setting, regardless of the transaction status shown in the exchange’s payment history. By enabling this option, you accept the associated risks.
{% endhint %}
