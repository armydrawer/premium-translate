1. If you have wallet addresses or card details and want to provide these details to users manually, first go to the "**Modules** -> **Modules**" section and make sure the module "**Currency Accounts for Directions (curraccaunts)**" is activated.

2. Next, go to "**Currency Accounts** -> **Currency Accounts**" and click "**Add**" to enter the card numbers or accounts that you will provide to users when they create a request.

- **Account Name** — enter a name for the account to make it easier to identify later  
- **Account** — enter the card/wallet/account number  
- **Daily Limit** — optionally set a daily limit; you won’t be able to accept amounts exceeding this limit on this account per day  
- **Monthly Limit** — optionally set a monthly limit; you won’t be able to accept amounts exceeding this limit on this account per month  

{% hint style="info" %}
If no limits are set, there will be no restrictions.
{% endhint %}

- **Uniqueness** — if set to "**Yes**", the account will be shown only once (one-time use account)  
- **Status** — set to "**Active Account**" to make it available

Click "**Save**", then "**Back to List**".

3. Next, you need to link the accounts. Go to the "**Exchange Direction**" section, click "**Add**", and on the page that opens, find the "**Currency Accounts**" tab where your created accounts will be listed. Check the boxes next to the accounts you plan to use.  

Also, select the "**Method**" by which the account will be displayed in the exchange direction:  
• **None** — accounts will not be displayed  
• **Random** — the system will select accounts based on the configured settings and limits (the most popular option)

4. Go to the "**User Information**" section and find the field labeled "**New Application**" — this is where you will link the created accounts.  
   
Select "**Amount to Send**" (the transfer amount) and "**Merchant Account**" (which shows the account number) from the shortcode panel. Then click "**Save**."
