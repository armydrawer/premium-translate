## Special Fields

**Required Number of Transaction Confirmations** – A confirmed transaction means it has been included in a block and thus added to the blockchain. It has been verified and recorded, the payment processed, and cannot be altered or reversed. For a transaction to be considered valid, it must receive a certain number of confirmations. Each additional confirmation exponentially reduces the risk of the transaction being reversed.

{% hint style="info" %}
* <mark style="color:green;">Recommended!</mark> Set the value to 0 so that the order is considered paid only after receiving the required number of confirmations on the exchange.
* <mark style="color:red;">Not recommended!</mark> If you set a value other than 0, the exchanger will change the order status to "Paid" according to this setting, regardless of the transaction status shown in the exchange’s payment history. By enabling this option, you accept the potential risks involved.
{% endhint %}
