If the installation and configuration of the Electrum module were performed by the specialists at Premium Exchanger, you’ll need to replace the test wallet on the server with the one you created after the work is completed.

**Note:** You may have multiple wallets in this folder. Select the correct wallet file, as you’ll need it for uploading to the server in the next step.

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default, the wallet is named **"default_wallet"**, but you may have given it a custom name during setup.
{% endhint %}

### 5. Open the ISP Manager panel in your browser and log in. Once logged in as the user created for the site (**not root**), navigate to the "File Manager" section in the sidebar.

### 6. Upload the wallet file you created (e.g., `default_wallet`) to the appropriate directory:

- For receiving funds: `electrum_in/Electrum-4.4.6/electrum_data/wallets/`  
- For sending funds: `electrum_out/Electrum-4.4.6/electrum_data/wallets/`  

If a warning appears stating that a file with the same name already exists, click "**Replace**."

### 7. In the directory `Electrum/Electrum-4.4.6/`, update the wallet password in the file **`start_or_restart_electrum_daemon.sh`**, which was previously uploaded to your server. If the password for the test wallet and your new wallet is the same, you can skip this step.

### 8. <mark style="color:red;">Restart the server</mark>.

After completing these steps, the test wallet on the server will be replaced with the wallet you created.
