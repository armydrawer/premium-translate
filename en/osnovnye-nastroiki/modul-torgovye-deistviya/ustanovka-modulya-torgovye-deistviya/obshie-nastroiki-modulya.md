The module includes settings that only need to be configured once to ensure proper operation moving forward.  

Go to the "**Trading Actions" -> "Settings"** section and configure the settings as shown in the screenshot below.

### **Hash for cron files**  
Setting a hash makes the cron URL more unique, which enhances security. We recommend using a hash that is at least 20 characters long and includes Latin letters and numbers. Example hash:  
`ImYkwGsq2fjhuWypiasq2fNasq2fdQJzVvCpiasq2fdQJzVvCpis8umbxs8umbx`  

### **Number of actions per run**  
The maximum number of actions that will be executed in a single task.  

### **Number of requests per action**  
The maximum number of requests that will be processed in a single action.

• **Yes**  
• **No**  

### **Logging trading scripts**  
Logs API requests to the exchange and their responses:  
• **Yes**

• **No** — The action will trigger **via a cron job.**  
• **Yes, if not in the admin panel** — The action will trigger **when the request status is changed by the merchant to "accepted" or "auto-payout."**  

### **Save trading information**
