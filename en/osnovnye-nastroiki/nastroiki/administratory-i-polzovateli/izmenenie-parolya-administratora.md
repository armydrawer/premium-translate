Locate the "**New Password**" field, enter a new password manually or use the password generator (the gear icon to the right of the field), and save the changes.

After changing the password for the administrator/manager/operator (any user with access to the admin panel), <mark style="color:red;">**be sure to**</mark> log out of all active sessions by clicking the "**log out of all devices**" button.\
Then, log back into the chosen account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Why this is important:**\
Logging out immediately ends all active sessions, including those of potential intruders, even if they accessed the account using stolen tokens or cookies. This helps prevent data theft, unauthorized changes, and the installation of hidden backdoors. Quick action minimizes damage, reduces the risk of further breaches, and simplifies incident investigation.
{% endhint %}

Steps to follow:

* Log into the administrator profile settings (in the "**Users**" section).
* Click the **"log out of all devices"** button (including the current session).

* Immediately change the password for this account to a new, more complex one (that hasn't been used before).
* Enable [**two-factor authentication (2FA)**](https://premium.gitbook.io/main/osnovnye-nastroiki/nastroiki/administratory-i-polzovateli/dvukhfaktornaya-avtorizaciya-2fa-v-paneli-upravleniya-saitom) if it hasn't been turned on yet.
* Notify the security team or senior administrator.
