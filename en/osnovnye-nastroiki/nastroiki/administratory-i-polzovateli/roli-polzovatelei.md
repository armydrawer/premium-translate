# User Roles

#### The **"User Roles"** section allows administrators or users with the appropriate permissions to:

* Create and edit roles.
* Manage the set of permissions for each role.
* Assign roles to users in their profiles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
- The **Administrator** role is a system role. It has full access to all platform functions, including role management, but **the role itself cannot be changed or deleted**.
- All other roles (e.g., _Manager_) can be edited.
{% endhint %}

#### How to Edit Any Role:

1. Go to the **"User Roles"** section.
2. Select any role from the list.
3. An editing form will open, including:
   * **Role Name** – can be changed (e.g., renamed to "manager").
   * **List of Permissions** – each permission can be toggled on or off.
   * **Description/Benefits (optional)** – for internal reference.

## Usage Recommendations

* The _Manager_ role is intended for employees who manage requests, content, and technical functions but should not have system administrator privileges.
* Only grant the manager the permissions required for their job description.
* For critical functions (e.g., system updates or mass data deletions), it is advisable to limit these permissions to trusted managers only.
* Schedule a review of permissions quarterly, especially after employee terminations and reorganizations.
