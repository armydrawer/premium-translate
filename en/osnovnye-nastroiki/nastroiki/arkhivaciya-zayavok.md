In the "**Settings**" ➔ "**Logging Settings**" section, you can specify the time interval after which created requests will be automatically sent to the archive.

In the "**Requests**" ➔ "**Archived Requests**" section, you will find the requests that are currently archived. You can filter the requests by various criteria and download them to your PC as a .csv file by clicking the "**Download Operations Archive**" button.

Please note that the filter on this page only applies to filtering requests within the section itself, not to the exported file.

The exported CSV file will include the following columns:
* **ID** — Request ID
* **Date** — Date of request creation
* **Rate** — Rate at the time of request creation
* **Amount Paid** — Amount to be paid by the client from the request
* **Amount Received** — Amount to be received by the client from the request
* **Status** — Status of the request (**only completed requests are exported**)
