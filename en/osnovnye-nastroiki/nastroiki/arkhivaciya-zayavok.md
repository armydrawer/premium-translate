In the "**Settings**" ➔ "**Logging Settings**" section, you can specify the time interval after which created requests will be automatically sent to the archive.

In the "**Requests**" ➔ "**Archived Requests**" section, you will find the requests that are currently archived. You can filter the requests by various criteria and download them to your PC as a .csv file by clicking the "**Download Operations Archive**" button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the filter on the page only applies to filtering requests within that section, not to the exported file.
{% endhint %}

The exported .csv file will include the following columns:
* **ID** — Request ID
* **Date** — Date the request was created
* **Rate** — Rate at the time the request was created
* **Amount Paid** — Amount to be paid by the client from the request
* **Amount Received** — Amount to be received by the client from the request
* **Status** — Status of the request (**only completed requests are exported**)
