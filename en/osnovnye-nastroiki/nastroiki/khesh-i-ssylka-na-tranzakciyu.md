# Transaction Hash and Link

When using automatic payouts for cryptocurrency, there is an option to display the transaction hash on the application page for the user.

To do this, go to the "**Exchange Directions**" section, edit the direction, and select the "**User Information**" tab.

Next, find the text field labeled "**Application Status**" and set it to "**completed application**." Above the text field, you will see a panel with shortcodes. The shortcode responsible for displaying the transaction hash is "**Automatic Payout Transaction ID**." Place your cursor in the field where you want the number of confirmations to appear, then click on the shortcode "**Automatic Payout Transaction ID**." The text field will display the code in square brackets **\[bid\_trans\_out]**, which will be converted into the transaction hash on the application page for the user.

The transaction hash can also be made into an active link. For example, the code for an active link to a Bitcoin transaction hash looks like this—copy the code and place it in the text field for "**Application Status**" set to "**completed application**":

`Link to transaction: https://www.blockchain.com/ru/btc/tx/[bid_trans_out]`

Please note that the transaction hash will not appear on the application page immediately—it takes some time for the payment gateway to process the application and provide the hash.
