# Authorization Log

In this section ("**Users**" ➔ "**Authorization Log**"), you can view all login attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) on your exchange platform.

For easier searching of specific data, you can use filters based on three criteria:

* **User** — display all login attempts made by a specific user
* **Start Date** — exclude all login attempts made before the specified date
* **End Date** — exclude all login attempts made after the specified date

You can also filter the data based on the success of the login attempts. By clicking the download button, a file containing the displayed data will be downloaded to your computer.

Additionally, you can set up email or Telegram notifications for each user upon login (notifications will only be sent to the users themselves).
