# Authorization Log

In this section ("**Users**" ➔ "**Authorization Log**"), you can view all authorization attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) on your exchange platform.

For easier searching of specific data, you can use filters based on three criteria:

* **User** — display all authorization attempts made by a specific user
* **Start Date** — exclude all authorization attempts made before the specified date
* **End Date** — exclude all authorization attempts made after the specified date

You can also filter the data based on the success of the authorization attempts. By clicking the download button, a file containing the displayed data will be downloaded to your computer.

Additionally, you can set up email or Telegram notifications for each user upon authorization (emails will only be sent to the users themselves).
