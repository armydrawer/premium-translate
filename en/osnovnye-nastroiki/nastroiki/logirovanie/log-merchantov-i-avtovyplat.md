Logs received from merchants and auto-payments can vary significantly in content due to differences in the development of each service. However, the log structure remains consistent and includes the following parameters:

**Date** — the date and time the log was received

**Data**:

* **url** — the address from which the log was received from the merchant
* **headers** — the log headers, containing information about the transaction
* **post_data** — the body of the log, containing transaction information sent to the merchant
* **result** — contains information about the actions performed, their results, and any errors received from the merchant

**Merchant/Auto-Payment** — the name of the merchant/auto-payment module that sent the log

**IP Address** — the IP address from which the log entry was received

**Request ID** — the ID of the client's request

For easier searching of specific data, you can use filters based on four criteria:

* **Start Date** — do not display logs received before the specified date and time
* **End Date** — do not display logs received after the specified date and time
