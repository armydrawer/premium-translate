To make it easier to search for specific data, you can use filters based on three criteria:

* **User Login** — display all applications from the specified user by their login
* **User ID** — display all applications from the specified user by their ID
* **Application ID** — display all statuses for a specific application

You can also filter the data by the type of status change — whether the transition to a new status was made by the user or the system.
