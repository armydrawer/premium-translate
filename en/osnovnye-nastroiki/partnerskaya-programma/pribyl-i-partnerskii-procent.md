The first field is the fixed amount for the partnership exchange - _"**"**S**_", and the second is the percentage of the sum of "**Sender**" or "Slot**" of the amount. In order to establish interest, the administrator needs to calculate the total profit in this direction of exchange and to indicate this interest for the currency "**Give**" or "**Render**" (at the discretion of the administrator but usually in the column "**Pent**"). The following paragraphs and settings are responsible for the calculation of the partnership remuneration: The value of the profit in each direction's settings on the**Curs** tab in the direction of exchange:\ • If the return is determined = **100%**, the partnership programme will operate on the basis of the "exceedance of the exchange."\ • If the profit is determined = **3%**, the partnership programme will operate on the principle of "exceedance of the exchanger's profits". ...PLACEHOLDER_HTMEL_TAG_17_PLACEHOLDER_HTML_TAG_18_PLACEHOLDER_HTMEL_TAG_19_PLACEHOLTER_TAG_19_PLACEHOLDER_HTML_TAG_20_PLACEHOLDER_HTML_TAG_21_PLACEHOLDER_HEADER_77___PLACEHOLDER_HEADER_78_The partnership programme must be set at 100 per cent of its profits (in per cent) in one of the relevant fields of "Exceed" or "Receition". In dependences, from which field you will indicate the value of the profits, this will be the amount of exchange from which the partner will be paid. If this amount is in a currency other than the USD, the amount will be converted to the USD at the internal rate of the system (from the section "** Currency**" ~ "** Currency Codes**") and then the partnership remuneration will be paid to the user. The value of profits can be specified for the "Give" and "Render" fields at the same time, but then it must be 50 per cent for I give and 50 per cent for I receive or 30 per cent for "Give" and 70 per cent for "Render" fields, the main thing is that the amount of interest is no more than 100 per cent. This 0.25 USD will receive the partner as its partnership reward._PLACEHOLDER_TEMPLATE_70_The profit settings need to establish the correct partner interest. Generally, the partnership interest between 0.1 and 1%. If your partnership programme is to operate on the "exchange rate profit" basis, it is necessary to indicate in the exchange direction the profit value as a percentage (e.g. 2%) in the respective field of "Grant" or "Receive." The value you have indicated will be the amount of exchange from which the partnership fee will be paid. If the sum is expressed in a currency other than the USD, the system automatically converts it to the USD at an internal rate (under "** Currency**" ) and then computes a partnership reward to the user. You can also indicate the profit value for both fields of "Give" and "Render" by allocating interest between them. We'll compute the exchanger's profits in this direction and get this . . . . . . . . . . In order to become a partner and receive a reward, one level of contribution should be created in the "Cutting" section of the partnership program in the management panel. For this level, the value of the parameter "**Summ More**" should be equal to 0. The partner will only receive its reward if it is at least $0.01. If the fee is less than this amount, it will not be credited to the partnership account. To avoid similar situations, set the parameter "**Min. This is the return of the exchange point that the exchanger will share with partners. *PLACEHOLDER_TEMPLATE_74_ or you can specify in the field _"_**S**_"_a fixed amount that the partner will receive in this direction, regardless of its partner interest._PLACEHOLDER_HEADER_80__ Starting with version 2.6, the script offers the possibility to use the sum or profit contributions for different partners.
