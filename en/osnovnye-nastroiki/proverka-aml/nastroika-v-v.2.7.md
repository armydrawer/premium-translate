In order to perform the verification, go to settings of a set-up service, specify the data to be checked and press the "**check**" button. It's like an "order number" in the system. The Hash transaction is used to check the integrity of the data in the locker. It guarantees that the transaction has not been changed since it was incorporated into the block. ♪ PLACEHOLDER_HEADER_200 ♪ Imagine that you're sending a letter: * **TxID** is the mail number that you get as soon as you send the letter to the post office. It helps track the letter before it is delivered. **Hash transactions** is a unique stamp on the envelope that comes after the letter is delivered and registered. It confirms that the letter was actually delivered and has not been changed. Thus, TxID and hash transactions are two stages of identification of transaction: before and after its inclusion in the box. _ PLACEHOLDER_TEMPLATE_179__ __ PLACEHOLDER_TEMPLATE_180__ __ PLACEHOLDER_TEMPLATE_181__ __ PLACEHOLDER_HTML_TAG_102___PLACEHOLDER_THAMEL_TAG_103_PLACEHOLDER_TAG_103_PLACEHOLDER_HTMER_TAG_103_HTMER_TAG_TAG_103_HTMER_TAG_104_HTMER_105_PLACEHOLDER_HTML_TAG_106_** Checking the address of the wallet.
