# Configuration in v.2.7

## AML Module Setup

Make sure the module is activated in the "**Modules**" section, or activate it if it isn't.

Add one of the four supported services in the "**AML**" -> "**Add**" section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't forget to top up your balance with the chosen service to be able to check addresses and transactions!

### Connecting to the Service <a href="#connecting-to-the-service" id="connecting-to-the-service"></a>

To connect to the service, contact the [manager](https://t.me/premiumexchanger_business) — they will create a chat with you and representatives from the AML service to discuss connection terms, rates, and other questions.

After gaining access to the service, top up your account to perform checks on client details on your exchange.

Go to your personal account, in the "[**API Keys**](https://kyt.bitok.org/api-keys)" section. Create a new key by clicking the "**Create Key**" button, and in the pop-up window, specify a desired name for the key and your server's IP address (optional).

## General Settings

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (178).png" alt="" width="329"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Risk if API is not working** — the desired risk value (from 0 to 100) that will be assigned to the check result if no response is received from the service API. The value <mark style="color:red;">**must be**</mark> higher than the value set in the "**Critical risk level for address/hash**" fields.

<div><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (179).png" alt="" width="325"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (180).png" alt="" width="326"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

**Critical risk level for address/hash** — <mark style="color:red;">**mandatory**</mark> to specify a value (from 0 to 100), above which the module will report a risk for requests in the "**Requests**" section (before configuring this section, we recommend consulting with the manager of the chosen AML service regarding risk level settings).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (183).png" alt="" width="322"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Waiting time for check result (sec, max 25-30 sec)** — the time to wait for a response from the service after sending data for verification (it is recommended to set a value between 15 and 28).

**Script timeout (sec)** — the time during which the site waits for a response from the AML service. If no response is received within the specified time, the site will continue its operation without an answer. If the time is not set or is equal to 0, the standard timeout of 20 seconds applies. There is no universal timeout value, as it depends on the speed of the specific service.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (182).png" alt="" width="281"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Disable logs** — turning off logs for checks (not recommended).

**Check categories** — setting risk levels for various categories. Consult with the service you are connecting to for assistance with fine-tuning categories (note that each module has its own set of categories for configuration).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (187).png" alt="" width="322"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Manual Checks

The AML module allows for manual checks of addresses, hashes, and transactions. To perform a check, go to the settings of the configured service, enter the data for verification, and click the "**Check**" button.

{% hint style="info" %}
TxID is a unique transaction identifier generated **before** the transaction is included in the blockchain. It is usually a hash of the transaction data (e.g., inputs, outputs, signatures) but is created before the transaction is included in a block.

* **What is it used for?**\
  TxID allows for quick identification of a transaction in the blockchain. It's like an "order number" in a system.
* **Example:**\
  When you send cryptocurrency, the TxID is what you see immediately after creating the transaction. It helps track the status of the transaction until it is confirmed.

A transaction hash is a unique identifier that is generated **after** the transaction is included in a block. It is calculated based on the transaction data and additional information (e.g., block number, time, and other parameters).

* **What is it used for?**\
  The transaction hash is used to verify the integrity of data in the blockchain. It ensures that the transaction has not been altered after being included in a block.
* **Example:**\
  The transaction hash can be compared to a "fingerprint" of the transaction after it is confirmed. It is unique and depends on all the data associated with the transaction in the block.

#### **Analogy**

Imagine you are sending a letter:

* **TxID** — this is the tracking number you receive immediately after handing the letter to the post office. It helps track the letter until it is delivered.
* **Transaction hash** — this is the unique stamp on the envelope that is placed after the letter is delivered and registered. It confirms that the letter was indeed delivered and has not been altered.

Thus, TxID and transaction hash are two stages of transaction identification: before and after it is included in the blockchain.

**Transaction Check** — This feature enables you to verify a transaction. Provide the recipient's wallet address, select the currency, enter the TxID, and choose the type of transaction (deposit or withdrawal).

**Hash Check** — This allows you to verify the hash from the response to the transaction check request.

The results of the checks will be displayed at the top of the page:

## Logging

In the "**AML**" -> "**Logs**" section, you will find the results of the checks as well as any errors encountered while using the services.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2048).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Module Configuration for Exchange Direction

You can use the module to check addresses and hashes without interfering with the request, or to block the creation of requests or prevent payouts.

Open the settings for the exchange direction where you want to implement the checks and navigate to the "**AML**" tab. Select the previously configured AML service and adjust the specified options.
