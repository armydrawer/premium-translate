You can create additional fields for currencies, which will be applied in the exchange form (e.g., "Bank Name," "Full Name"). Users will need to fill in these fields when submitting an application.

**Field Name** — the name of the field as it appears in the exchange form on the website.

**Unique ID** — the ID used to pass data from the field via the shortcode `[uniq_id="your_ID"]`.

**Field Type:**
