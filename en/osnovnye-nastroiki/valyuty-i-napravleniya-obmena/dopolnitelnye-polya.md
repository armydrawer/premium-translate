You can create additional fields for currencies that will be used in the exchange form (for example, "Bank Name," "Full Name") — the user will need to fill out these fields when creating a request.

**Status** — activates the field for the exchange form.

**Additional Field Name (Technical)** — the name of the field as it appears in the admin panel.

**Additional Field Name** — the name of the field as it appears on the exchange form on the website.

**Unique ID** — the ID used to pass data from the field via the shortcode `[uniq_id="your_ID"]`.

**Field Type:**

* Text Field — for short values (up to 100 characters).
* Text Area — for longer values.
* Selection — a choice from available options without the ability to enter a custom value in the exchange form. In this case, you will need to specify the options available for selection.
