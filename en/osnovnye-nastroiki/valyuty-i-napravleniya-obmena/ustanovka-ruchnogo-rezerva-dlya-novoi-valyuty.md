# Setting a Manual Reserve for a New Currency

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using the auto-payout module, you can receive the reserve for this payment system directly from your wallet in real time. In this case, when creating a currency, select the appropriate wallet for the "**Currency Reserve**" parameter. If you do this, the steps described below are not necessary.
{% endhint %}

If you want to set the currency reserve manually, go to the "**Reserve Adjustment**" section in the sidebar. Click the "**Add**" button located above the table of existing currencies.

In the window that opens, fill in the fields "**Comment**", "**Amount**", and "**Currency**":

* **Comment** – optionally enter a note or reminder for this transaction  
* **Amount** – enter the amount by which you want to increase the reserve for this currency  
* **Currency** – select the currency from the dropdown list for which you are setting the reserve  

Click "**Save**" to apply your changes.

Please note: if, for any reason unrelated to exchange operations on the site, the currency reserve has increased or decreased, you need to update the reserve manually. Repeat the steps above to adjust the reserve, entering the amount of change in the "**Amount**" field (use a minus sign “-” for decreases). For example, if the reserve decreased by 500 units, enter “-500” in the amount field. Then click "**Save**" to update the reserve.

{% hint style="info" %}
The currency reserve amount updates automatically after each exchange. Manual reserve adjustment is intended for cases when you need to add or withdraw funds from the balance used by your exchanger.
