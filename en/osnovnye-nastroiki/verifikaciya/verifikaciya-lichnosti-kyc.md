# Identity Verification (KYC)

The script includes an identity verification feature with the option to upload images. You can also restrict access to certain exchange directions, making them available only to users who have been verified on the site. Additionally, you can offer verified users extra discounts on exchanges.

To enable identity verification, follow these steps:

1. In the website control panel, go to **Modules → Modules** and activate the **User Verification** module.

4. In the control panel, under **Messages → E-mail Templates**, set up and enable the following templates: **Identity Verification Request**, **Successful Identity Verification**, and **Identity Verification Denied**.

5. In the exchange direction settings, under the **Verification** tab, set **Only for users verified on the site** to **Yes**. This will restrict the ability to create exchange requests to verified users only.

If the verification link or verification status does not appear in the user’s personal account, enable the option in the menu under **Appearance → Widgets → Sidebar → Personal Data block**.
