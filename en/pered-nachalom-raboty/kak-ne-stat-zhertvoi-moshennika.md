# How to Avoid Becoming a Victim of Fraud

We strongly advise against purchasing so-called licensed products from third-party websites, as genuine and secure products are only available through our official sites: [**Best-Curs.info**](https://best-curs.info/) and [**PremiumExchanger.com**](https://premiumexchanger.com/). We do not have any partners selling our products. Third-party sites often sell products where scammers have embedded remote site control features, altered payment details, or access to merchant data. Don’t entrust your money to just anyone. Use only licensed products to protect your funds and safeguard your reputation.

We never ask you to send us copies of products to fix vulnerabilities.

Do not sell copies of our products to third parties — this can harm your website’s functionality, violates our [license agreement](https://premiumexchanger.com/terms-personal-data/), and in some cases may lead to unauthorized charges on your account. Our products are domain-locked, so third parties won’t be able to use them. Offers to buy copies of our products usually come from scammers.

We do not send product update files via email. Our newsletters are for informational purposes only and simply notify you when updates are available. You can download all product updates exclusively from your [personal account](https://premiumexchanger.com/uscripts/).

Exchange site administrators often receive emails from attackers containing attachments (archives, PDFs, DOC files, images, etc.) that may include viruses or trojans. Do not open such attachments unless absolutely necessary, and always scan them with antivirus software.

You can purchase products, modules, and merchant tools only through our official websites. We do not sell products via ICQ, Skype, email, or similar channels. Beware of scammers offering cheaper products through suspicious communication methods.

Our service provides user support exclusively through the following communication channels:

* Skype: [hi_firer](skype:hi_firer?add)  
* Telegram: [@premiumexchanger](https://t.me/premiumexchanger)  
* Email: info[at]best-curs.info, bestcursinfo[at]gmail.com  
* Online chat on our website  

Official informational emails are sent only from the address info@best-curs.info.

If you receive any messages claiming to be from us but coming from different or similar contact details, we recommend that you ignore them.
