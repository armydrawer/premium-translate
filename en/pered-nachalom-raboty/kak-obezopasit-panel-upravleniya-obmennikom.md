# How to Secure the Exchange Office Control Panel

To protect the exchange office control panel and the administrator account, we recommend taking the following steps:

Here is a natural, fluent English translation of the provided text:

* Change the default administrator password for the control panel the first time you use the system. For more details, see [this link](https://premium.gitbook.io/rukovodstvo-polzovatelya/navigaciya/faq/kak-izmenit-parol-administratora).  
* Do not use standard usernames like admin, superuser, administrator, etc. for the site administrator. Create an administrator account with a unique and strong username, then delete the original administrator account. When you delete the original administrator account, the system will reassign all pages and posts to the new administrator.  
* Restrict access to the control panel by IP address in "**Users → Your Profile → Allowed IP Addresses**."  
* In the control panel under "**Messages → E-mail Templates**," configure the templates "**Login Notification**" and "**One-Time Login Link**." For more information on setting up templates, see [this section](https://premium.gitbook.io/rukovodstvo-polzovatelya/navigaciya/uvedomleniya/opovesheniya-po-e-mail).  
* In the control panel under "**Users →** select your profile → set "**Yes**" for "**Email notification on login**" and "**One-time login link**." These settings must be enabled for all users who have access to the control panel. Each time an administrator logs in, they will receive a one-time login link via email. Additionally, the administrator will get an email notification upon successful login to the control panel.  
* Every site administrator should use an email account with active SMS-based two-factor authentication enabled. Services like Gmail or Mail.ru support SMS-based authorization.  
* We strongly recommend **not saving** usernames and passwords in your browser.  
* Do not grant control panel access to unauthorized users unless absolutely necessary. For such cases, create a separate administrator account and be sure to delete it after access is no longer needed and the work is completed.  
* Avoid using third-party WordPress plugins. Statistics show that vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access to your site are most often found in third-party plugins.
