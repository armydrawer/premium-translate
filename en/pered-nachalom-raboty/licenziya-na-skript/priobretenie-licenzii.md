# Acquiring a License

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please read this notice before proceeding with this section. If you have purchased the script, it is not possible to modify, alter, or transfer the license to another domain. For a second domain, you will need an additional license. If you are renting the script, you can transfer the license to another domain one day before the end of the paid period. The license becomes active immediately after clicking the "**Download**" button. Before installing the script, you must first specify the domain name, click "**Download**," and then generate the license file and upload it to the root folder of your website.
{% endhint %}

## Purchasing a License

1. Go to the "[**Your Licenses**](https://premiumexchanger.com/ulicense/)" section on our website.
2. In the "**Domain Name**" field, enter your domain name for the script installation without including "www" or "https://", and click the "**Save**" button.

3. Download the license files for the latest version of the script by clicking the corresponding "**Download**" button. The latest version is the one with the highest version index. If you need a specific version of the script, click the "**Download**" button for the desired version index.

Download the archive _`license.zip`_ and upload it to the root folder of your website (this is typically the `public_html`, `www`, or `docs` folder). Make sure to extract the contents of the archive.
