# License Acquisition

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please read this notice before you start working with this section. If you purchased the script, you cannot change, modify, or transfer the license to another domain. You will need an additional license for a second domain. If you rented the script, you can change the license to another domain one day before the end of the paid period. The license becomes active immediately after you click the "**Download**" button. Before installing the script, you must first specify the domain name, click the "**Download**" button, then generate the license file and upload it to the root folder of your website.
{% endhint %}

## Purchasing a License

1. Go to the "[**Your Licenses**](https://premiumexchanger.com/ulicense/)" section on our website.
2. In the "**Domain Name**" field, enter your domain name for the script installation without the www and https:// prefix, and click the "**Save**" button.

3. Download the license files for the latest version of the script by clicking the corresponding "**Download**" button. The latest version is the one with the highest index. If you need a specific version of the script, click the "**Download**" button with the desired version index.
