# General Safety Measures

* Use strong passwords (at least 15-25 characters) for accessing payment systems, the exchanger control panel, hosting, and databases. Use a unique password for each site.
* Use only licensed antivirus software, such as [Kaspersky Antivirus](https://www.kaspersky.com).
* Regularly update the exchanger platform and WordPress. Update files for the exchanger are always available in your [personal account](https://premiumexchanger.com/uscripts/) on our website. We send official notifications about new updates, and you will also see a warning icon in the site control panel when an update is available.
* The site administrator should work in a secure environment and follow safe internet practicesâ€”specifically, avoid saving passwords in browsers or FTP clients, and protect the workstation with antivirus software and a firewall.
* By default, the system disables the ability to upload and edit third-party plugins and themes. This restriction helps minimize the risk of malicious changes to system files. We strongly recommend disabling this protection only when absolutely necessary and re-enabling it immediately after completing your work.
* Do not send access credentials for the site control panel or server via messengers such as Skype, Viber, etc. If you must send such information through messengers, be sure to delete the messages afterward and change your passwords immediately.
