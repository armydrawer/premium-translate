# How to Avoid Falling Victim to Scammers

Due to the increasing number of various types of fraud, we urge you to pay close attention to the following recommendations:

* **Avoid purchasing so-called licensed products from third-party websites.** Licensed and secure products are available exclusively on our official websites: [**Best-Curs.info**](https://best-curs.info/) and [**PremiumExchanger.com**](https://premiumexchanger.com/). We do not have any partners authorized to sell our products. Products sold on third-party websites are often modified by scammers to include remote access tools, credential substitution, or merchant data theft. Do not entrust your money to unverified sources. Always use licensed products to protect your funds and maintain your reputation.

* **We never ask you to send back copies of our products to fix vulnerabilities.**

* **Do not sell copies of our products to third parties.** Doing so may harm your websiteâ€™s functionality, violate our [license agreement](https://premiumexchanger.com/terms-personal-data/), and, in some cases, lead to unauthorized withdrawals from your accounts. Our products are domain-locked, meaning third parties cannot use them. Any offers to purchase copies of our products are likely from scammers.

* **We do not send product update files via email.** Our email notifications are strictly informational and only inform you about the release of updates. You can download available updates exclusively from your [personal account](https://premiumexchanger.com/uscripts/).

* **Beware of malicious email attachments.** Scammers often send emails to exchange administrators with attached files (archives, .pdf or .doc files, images, etc.) that contain viruses or trojans. Do not open such attachments unless absolutely necessary, and always scan them with antivirus software.

* **Purchase products, modules, and merchant tools only through our official websites.** We do not sell products via ICQ, Skype, email, or other unofficial channels. Be cautious of scammers offering discounted products through suspicious communication methods.
