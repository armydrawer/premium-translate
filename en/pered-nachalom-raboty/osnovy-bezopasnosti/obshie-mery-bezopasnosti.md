# Safety Guidelines for Working with the System

## General Safety Measures

* Use complex passwords (at least 15-25 characters) for accessing payment systems, the exchange panel, hosting, and databases. Ensure that each site has a unique password.
* Only use licensed antivirus software, such as [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com).
* Regularly update the exchange platform and WordPress. Update files for the exchange platform are always available in your [personal account](https://premiumexchanger.com/uscripts/) on our website. We will send official notifications when updates are released, and you will also see a warning sign in the site management panel when an update is available.
* The site administrator should work in a secure environment and follow safe internet practices (specifically, do not save passwords in your browser or FTP client, and protect your workspace with antivirus software and a firewall).
* By default, the system disables the ability to upload and edit third-party plugins and themes. This restriction minimizes the risk of malicious changes to system files. We strongly recommend disabling this protection only in extreme cases and remember to re-enable it after completing your work.
* Do not send access credentials for the site management panel and server through messaging apps like Skype, Viber, etc. If you must send such information via messaging apps, be sure to delete those messages and change your passwords afterward.
