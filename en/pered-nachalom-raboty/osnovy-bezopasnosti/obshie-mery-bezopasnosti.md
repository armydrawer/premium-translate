# Safety Guidelines for Working with the System

## General Safety Measures

* Use strong passwords (15-25 characters minimum) to access payment systems, the exchanger control panel, hosting, and databases. Ensure each site has a unique password.
* Always use licensed antivirus software, such as [Kaspersky Antivirus](https://www.kaspersky.com).
* Regularly update your exchange platform and WordPress installation. Update files for the exchange platform are always available in your [personal account](https://premiumexchanger.com/uscripts/) on our website. We send official notifications about updates, and you will also see a warning sign in the website control panel when an update is available.
* The website administrator should work in a secure environment and follow safe internet practices (e.g., avoid saving passwords in browsers or FTP clients, and protect the workstation with antivirus software and a firewall).
* By default, the system disables the ability to upload and edit third-party plugins and themes. This restriction minimizes the risk of malicious changes to system files. We strongly recommend only disabling this protection when absolutely necessary and re-enabling it immediately after completing your tasks.
* Do not share access credentials for the website control panel or server through messaging apps like Skype, Viber, etc. If you must send such information via messengers, make sure to delete the messages afterward and change the passwords immediately.
