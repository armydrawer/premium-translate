# Acquiring a License

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please read this notice before you start working with this section. If you have purchased the script, you cannot modify, alter, or transfer the license to another domain. You will need to purchase an additional license for a second domain. If you have rented the script, changing the license to another domain is possible only one day before the paid period expires. The license becomes active immediately after clicking the "**Download**" button. Before installing the script, you must first specify your domain name, click "**Download**," then generate the license file and upload it to the root folder of your website.
{% endhint %}

## Purchasing a License

1. Go to the "[**Your Licenses**](https://premiumexchanger.com/ulicense/)" section on our website.
2. In the "**Domain Name**" field, enter your domain name for the script installation without "www" or "https://", then click the "**Save**" button.

3. Download the license files for the latest version of the script by clicking the corresponding "**Download**" button. The latest version is the one with the highest version number. If you need a specific version of the script, click the "**Download**" button next to the desired version number.
