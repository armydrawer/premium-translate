# Choosing a Server

To ensure the stable operation of the script, a server with the following minimum specifications is required:

* 4 GB of RAM  
* Ubuntu 20.x or 22.x  
* ISP Manager server control panel or the ability to install it  
* Nginx+Apache web server  

Other specifications are up to you, but pay attention to the server's storage capacity to ensure there is enough space for the database, module logs, backups, and other data (at least 50 GB). Typically, a VPS with SSD storage is used for cryptocurrency exchange platforms.
