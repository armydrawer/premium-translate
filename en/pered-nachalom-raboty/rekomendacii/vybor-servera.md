# Server Selection

For the script to run smoothly, the server should meet the following minimum requirements:

* 4 GB of RAM  
* Ubuntu 20.x or 22.x  
* ISP Manager control panel installed or the ability to install it  
* Nginx + Apache web server  

Other specifications are up to you, but be sure to pay attention to the server’s storage capacity. You’ll need enough space to store the database, module logs, backups, and other data (at least 50 GB). Typically, a VPS with SSD storage is used for a cryptocurrency exchange.
