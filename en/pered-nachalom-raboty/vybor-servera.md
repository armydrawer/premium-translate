# Server Selection

For stable script operation, the server must meet the following minimum requirements:

* 4 GB of RAM
* Ubuntu 20.x or 22.x
* ISP Manager control panel installed or the ability to install it
* Nginx + Apache web server

Other specifications are up to you, but pay attention to the serverâ€™s storage capacity to ensure there is enough space for the database, module logs, backups, and other data (at least 50 GB). Typically, a VPS with SSD storage is used for a cryptocurrency exchange.
